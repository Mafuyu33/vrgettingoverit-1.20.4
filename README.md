This is a mod created by Mafuyu33, allowing VR players to experience the movement style of the famous game "Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy". When players join the game, they will be given an item. When it is detected that the player holding this item is a VR player, they can automatically enter the mode of moving with a hammer. The movement mode is very intuitive, allowing players to push themselves by interacting with various blocks using the hammer. Switching the item between left and right hands can change the main hand of the hammer.
